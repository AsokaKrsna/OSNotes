## ⚠️ Known Limitations

OSNotes is for **personal, local note-taking**. It does NOT provide:

- Encryption at rest (notes are plain PDFs)
- Password protection (relies on device lock)
- Secure deletion
- Enterprise/compliance features

For highly sensitive data, use dedicated encryption tools.

## 🛡️ For Users

- Keep your device updated and encrypted
- Use a strong lock screen
- Be careful when sharing exported PDFs
- In case you are using any third party integration to backup your notes, OSNotes is not responsible for anything

Thanks for helping keep OSNotes secure. 🙏
